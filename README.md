# Next.js Blank Page Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js applications where the application renders a blank page instead of the expected content. The issue is resolved by ensuring that the Next.js application is properly configured and that there are no errors in the code that prevent rendering. 

## Bug
The bug is that the Next.js application renders a blank page instead of the content of the `Home` component. This is caused by an improper configuration of the application or an error in the code.

## Solution
The solution is to ensure that the application is correctly configured and that there are no errors in the code. This includes checking the Next.js configuration file (`next.config.js`) and ensuring that there are no errors in the application code.
